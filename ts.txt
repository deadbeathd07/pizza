Task #1 - Who eats pizza?
We're going to have a party soon. Fortunately, somebody has created an API https://gp-js-test.herokuapp.com/pizza which returns the list of participants for this party. 
And our mama will make a pizza for us. There is only one issue - we don't know how to split this pizza evenly - that's why we need your help. 
You need to get the list of participants from API and draw for me a pizza-slice, so I can split pizza into even pieces between all pizza eaters. 
Please, count only participants, who will eat pizza. For some strange reason the number of pizza-eaters is always even... May this tip help you in drawing?

How PizzaSliceApp should work?
1. Once the page loaded we should see only "Load" button
2. When clicking the "Load" button:
   1. request for party participants should be launched, "waiting..." text should appear (while the request is ongoing), "Load" button should receive "loading" class 
   2. when the request arrives, "waiting..." text should be hidden, "loading" class from "Load" button should be removed
   3. PizzaSlice drawing should appear
   4. Text with the number of party participants and pizza eaters should be rendered under the PizzaSlice
How PizzaSliceApp should look?
The sketch already contains some elements for your fast start. Please, change styles anyhow you like to make the app look nice. You can use only CSS3 and HTML5, 
no external libs (like bootstrap or analogs). 
Pizza slices drawing should reflect how you'd cut pizza for n eaters in real life.
Under the PizzaSlice place a text, which will tell how many participants will be at the party and how many of them will eat pizza. 
This text and PizzaSlice should be updated on every receive of participants by clicking the "Load" button.
